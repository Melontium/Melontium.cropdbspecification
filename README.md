# CropDB Spec

This project serves to outline a standardized specification for representing
farm crop data in a simple [YAML] file format.

The goal is to enable farmers, seed producers, researchers, and software
developers to share sets of data about specific species/varieties/cultivars
among one another.

This spec is proof-of-concept that was inspired by discussion in the
[OpenFarm issue queues on Github].

See cropdb.schema.yml and db/example.yml for specification details.
